    %h2 Being apart of something bigger then yourself
  %p
    Whether you are into extremely competitive gaming or just casual game play with friends, its always better when there is team synergy. We feel like a large frustration in the game is when teammates donâ€™t get along and game play starts to go from fun to frustrating. We have made assembling a team quick and easy. Team up with players who have similar gaming schedules (nights and weekends etc). Fill a specific role your team is missing. See actual game stats on a player before you chose to accept them into team.
  %p
    Once a team is assembled keep track of all your matches, collaborate on the game play strategies, and critic each others plays. With match notes and living team chat you can keep a record on each match.
